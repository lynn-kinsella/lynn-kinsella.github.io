              I'm a Computer Engineering graduate from McMaster University with a passion for developing software that people want to use.
              I have experience writing both front and back-end code through my year working at IBM, my courses at McMaster, and my personal projects and exploration.
            </p>
            <p>
              I love finding ways to apply my skills and acquiring new ones! My expertise includes modern web development for both front-end and back-end,
              as well as writing embedded software. I'm also keenly interested in UX research and design, image processing, and machine learning,
              and want to explore those fields further in the future.
            </p>
